# Authentication

This API uses **token-based authentication**. To access any secured endpoint, include your API token in the `Authorization` header.

## Example

Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN


Tokens can be obtained through the `/login` or `/register` endpoints (not implemented in this example).
